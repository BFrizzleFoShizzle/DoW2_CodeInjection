------------------------------

1. Installation:

You need WinXP or later to run the tool. Extract DoW2_Load.exe to the place of your choice and put LuaLibLoad.dll into your Dawn of War 2 directory.

------------------------------

2. Usage:

Start DoW2_Load.exe with "LuaLibLoad.dll" (without "") as a commandline parameter to load up the LuaLibLoad.dll; you may add more parameters to load more DLLs.
LuaLibLoad.dll extends the loadfile() function used by LUA to enable you to call functions from libraries: loadfile(library-name, function-name). Now start DoW2.exe.

DONE.
